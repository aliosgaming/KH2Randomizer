## Heads up!
* Feel free to go to the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vKhdwNAmzE) for help with the setup, there is a dedicated #help channel where you can find people to assist you if you're facing any difficulties. (P.S. Please be polite)
* **You must run the game once** before you start the guide. Otherwise it may not boot up correctly after the randomizer is installed.
* **VERIFY GAME FILES** through the Epic Games Launcher for Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix (v1.0.0.8_WW), they need to be clean/unpatched files for the extraction process to work.
* If you have EVER installed the KH2 Randomizer before then please check your `C:\Documents\KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX\scripts\kh2 folder` (if you have one) and EMPTY IT.
* Unofficial copies of the game are not supported, it is strongly recommended you buy and install the game directly from the Epic Game Store.

## Resources Needed:
* [OpenKH Mod Manager](https://github.com/aliosgaming/OpenKh/releases/download/v3.0.0/OpenKH.Mod.Manager.2023.zip)
* [Seed Generator](https://github.com/tommadness/KH2Randomizer/releases/latest/download/Kingdom.Hearts.II.Final.Mix.Randomizer.zip)
* [.NET6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.13-windows-x64-installer)

## Installing OpenKH Mod Manager and Seed Generator
1. Install .NET6 Runtime by running the `runtime-desktop-6.0.13-windows-x64-installer` executable you just downloaded
2. Create a KH2 Rando folder somewhere on your PC (__This **cannot** be under a Microsoft "OneDrive" directory, nor should you install on an external hard drive__). This is where you will put the Randomizer software
3. Extract OpenKH Mod Manager to this folder 
4. Extract the Seed Generator to this Folder (Be sure to extract ALL files from the zip)
	- It's recommended to give each app its own subfolder to make navigating their files easier (See screenshot)

## How to Setup The Mod Manager:
1. Run the **"OpenKh.Tools.ModsManager.exe"** in the OpenKH folder 
	- The Setup Wizard will open automatically, click **"Next"** to start
2. Change game edition to **"PC Release Via Epic Games Store"**
3. Then click the folder icon and navigate to your KH1.5_2.5 installation folder (The default is `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\KH_1.5_2.5` but this may differ from your own)

![Setup Wizard-Game Edition](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Game%20Edition%20Window.png)

4. Click the **"Install OpenKH Panacea"** Button. This will install the mod loader to your game installation folder
	- If you want to verify it was added successfully, check your game's install folder for a file called `DBGHELP.DLL`

![Panacea Wizard Window](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Panacea%20Install%20Window.png)

5. OpenKH can launch KH2 directly from the Epic Games Store Launcher. This option can save you time and a few clicks whenever you want to run the game after changing your mods or seed. It's recommended to enable this but is not required.

![Launch Via Epic Games](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Luanch%20Via%20Epic%20Games%20Option.png)

6. The mod manager now has the option to extract multiple games from the KH1.5_2.5 collection. For the purposes of this guide you only need to extract KH2, but feel free to extract the others as well if you plan on modding those games, or for including their music in the seed generators "music rando" option. Once you are ready, press the **Extract Game Data** button to begin extraction. It usually takes 5-15 minutes (for KH2 alone) depending on your hardware so please be patient.
7. Once the extraction is complete, click on **Next** and on the next window click **Finish**. You have successfully installed the Mods Manager!

![Extraction Window](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Extraction%20Window.png)

## Lua Backend Installation:
1. Open the seed Generator Program `KH2 Randomizer.exe`
2. In the top left click on the **"Configure"** tab, then click on **"Luabackend Hook Setup (PC Only)**

![Backend Hook Setup 1](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Backend%20Hook%20Setup%201.png)

3. In this new window click on **"browse"** next to the OpenKh Location, and browse to your openkh folder, then click **"select folder"**
4. For **"Mod mode"**, click the drop down and select **"Panacea/Mod Loader"**
5. Click on **"Check configuration"**
	* *The status messages below should say "Not Found"*

6. Now click on the **"Download/Install/Configure"** button in the bottom left. You can now close this window.

## Garden of Assemblage Mod Installation:
Installing new mods into the mods manager is easy! Follow these steps to get the main Garden of Assemblage mod installed:

1. Be sure the game selected in the top right of the main window shows **Kingdom Hearts 2**
2. Next, Click **"Mods"** in the top left drop down menu

![Install New Mod](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Install%20New%20Mod.png)

2. In the **"Add a new mod from Github"** section, type in the account name and mod name.
	- Type **"KH2FM-Mods-Num/GoA-ROM-Edition"** into the text box and click on **"Install"** in the bottom right

![Install GoA ROM](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Install%20GoA%20ROM.png)

3. To enable the mod, be sure to click the checkbox next to the newly added mod in the list

![Enable GoA ROM](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Enable_GoA_ROM.png)

4. Then click **"Mod Loader"** then **"Build Only"**
* *If you enabled "Launch via Epic Games" in setup wizard, you can also choose to **"Build and Run"** here. This option will build your mod files and then immediately run the game for you.*

![Build Only](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Build%20Only.png)

* *Note: Newly enabled mods won't show up in game unless you **"Build"** after enabling them*

## Installing a new seed to play:
1. Choose your seed settings in the generator window and then click on **"Generate Seed"** in the bottom right.

![Generate Seed](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Generate%20Seed.png)

*Some settings act differently between the PC and Emulator versions of the game (example: Boss Enemy Rando). If you enable one of these settings then the "Generate Seed" button will split into two separate buttons for PC and Emulator. Be sure you click the right one for your game version.

2. This will open up a window to save the seed as a zip file. Save it anywhere that works for you (I like to place it in the same folder as the generator)
3. Once saved, open up the mod manager and click on **"Mods"**, then **"Install a New Mod"**
4. This time click on **"Select and Install Mod Archive"**, navigate to your new seed zip file and click **"Open"**
5. Be sure to click on the check box next to the seed, then click on **"Build"** and **"Build Only"** to enable the mod in game. Note the 4 buttons to the right of the mod list. The First button lets you move a mod up the list, the second moves them down the list. The Green '+' icon is a shortcut to install a new mod, while the Red "-" icon is a shortcut to deleting a mod
	- **How to install a new seed in the future:** Create a new zip seed file using the generator. Delete the current seed from your Mods Manager. Add the new zip seed to your mods manager. Enable the seed, "Build and Run"

![Install New Seed](../images/Panacea-ModLoader/Install%20New%20Seed-Updated.gif)

### *Note: As you add more mods to the Mods Manager it is a general rule that the Seed goes at the **top** of the list and the GoA mod goes at the **bottom** unless a mods description says otherwise*

*Editors note: I heavily recommend you install these two mods to help provide a better experience when playing rando -*

* **KH2FM-Mods-equations19/auto-save** - This mod auto saves the game for you as you enter rooms. Be sure to make at least 1 regular save in game, then if you ever crash or your game closes unexpectedly, just hold the **SELECT** button while loading a save, and the auto-save will be loaded instead.
* **KH2FM-Mods-equations19/soft-reset** - Hold **L1+L2+R1+R2+Start** at the same time to immediately reset the game to the start screen. Very useful if you accidentally softlock in boss/enemy rando, or just to restart the game faster!
* **[KH2 Rando Tracker](https://github.com/Dee-Ayy/KH2Tracker/releases/latest)** - Not an OpenKH mod but instead a full automated tracking program for the Important Checks in game. Checkout [Hint Systems](https://kh2rando.com/hints) for info about different ways to play Rando!


# *You are now ready to play the KH2 Randomizer!*

__Technical And Stability Notes__
1. As mentioned earlier in the guide, the Mod Manager/Lua doesn't seem to work if the folder is under a "OneDrive" directory. We don't know exactly why but it's a conistent thing between users. Be sure to move your folders and re-run the setup wizards if you installed in a "OneDrive" directory.
2. Recommended to set fps limit to **60fps**.
3. Recommended to run game in windows/borderless windowed mode. Fullscreen is stable but the game can crash if you alt-tab out.
4. Overlays that hook onto the game process (Steam, RivaTuner, Nvidia Overlay, etc) and recording programs (Obs, Streamlabs, Xsplit) seem to decrease stability when playing rando. It's recommended to disable them, or in the case of recording programs use window/desktop capture, in order to minimize your chances of a crash.
5. GoA ROM and the Seed Generator will always be compatible with one another. Any other mods beyond that should be compatible as long as they don't overlap on changes. Mods at the top of the list will overwrite mods below them if there's any overlapping files. Feel free to ask in the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/vKhdwNAmzE) if you aren't sure.
6. Boss/Enemy Rando is amazing but still a work in progress. Please report any bugs/softlocks/out-of-bounds glitches you encounter to the coresponding Google Form listed in the #bug-reports channels of our Discord.
